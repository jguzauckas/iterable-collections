This repository is designed to introduce you to basic types of collections/iterables in Python.

There are four major types:
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Tuples

In this repository, there is two files for each of these types, one with notes materials and the other with practice.

The recommended order to go through these files is:
1. Tuples
2. Lists
3. Sets
4. Dictionaries
