#Complete the assignments below on dictionaries.

#Create a variable called 'nums' that holds a dict made up
#of the pairs "hello" and 2, "hi" and 1, and "howdy" and 4


#Create a dictionary with the variable 'names' that contains 4
#elements whose keys are your favorite teacher's names and
#the values are the classes you took with them


#Print the two dicts we've created


#Print the value paired with "hi" in 'nums', and choose a teacher
#to print their associated class in 'names'.


#Print a check to see if "Guzauckas" is a key in 'names'


#Change the value associated with 'hello' in 'nums' to 7


#Add another teacher:class pair to 'names'


#Remove the pair with the key 'hi' from 'nums'


#Clear the dict 'nums'


#Print out all of the dicts you've defined so far


#Use f-strings like I did on line 70 of dicts.py to print the lengths
#of each of our dicts
