#Complete the assignments below on lists.

#Create a variable called 'nums' that holds a list
#made up of the numbers 17, 22.1, 44, 333


#Here is a pre-made tuple of names:
t = ("Guzauckas", "Cawley", "Lorenzet", "Kirchmeier")
#Use the list constructor to turn this tuple into a list with
#the variable name 'names'


#Here is a string:
s = "I Love CS"
#Use the list constructor to turn this string into a list
#with the variable name 'cs'


#Print the first element of 'nums', the fourth element of 'names'
#and the 6th element of 'cs'. Remember zero indexing!


#Change the second value of 'nums' to 10, change the third value of
#'names' to "Newton", and change the fourth value of 'cs' to 'i'


#Remove the value 44 from 'nums', and remove the first value of
#'names'


#Add the value "Cullen" in the second slot of 'names', and add
#the value '!' to the end of 'cs'


#Here is a pre-created tuple of names:
t = ("Semenuk", "Leroux")
#Add these names to the end of 'names'


#Print out all of the lists you've defined so far


#Use f-strings like I did on line 64 of lists.py to print the lengths
#of each of our three lists
