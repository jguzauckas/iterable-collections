#Complete the assignments below on sets.

#Create a variable called 'nums' that holds a set
#made up of the numbers 24, 7.66, 22, -5


#Here is a pre-made tuple of names:
t = ("Abby", "Madeline", "Evan", "Carnel")
#Use the set constructor to turn this tuple into a set with
#the variable name 'names'


#Here is a string:
s = "I am in class"
#Use the set constructor to turn this string into a list
#with the variable name 'inclass'


#Print the sets we've made so far


#Remove the value 22 from 'nums', and remove the last value of
#'names'


#Add the value "Cullen" to 'names'


#Here is a pre-created tuple of names:
t = ("Semenuk", "Leroux")
#Add these names to the end of 'names'


#Print out all of the sets you've defined so far


#Use f-strings like I did on line 73 of sets.py to print the lengths
#of each of our three sets
